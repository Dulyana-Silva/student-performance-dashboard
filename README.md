## Techniques Used
### 🧪 Jupyter notebook
 - Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live codes, visualizions.
 - You can write and run code, see outputs instantly under the code cells, and create reports that combine text and visuals in one place.
 
### 🐼 Pandas
- Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- In this project, pandas was used for loading and inspecting the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and calculating summary statistics and trends

### 📊 Matplotlib
- Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- It was used to generate various plots (such as bar charts, histograms, and pie charts) that helped visualize the relationships between student habits and academic performance.
