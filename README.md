# Student Performance Dashboard 

A data analysis and visualization project exploring how student habits impact academic performance using Python, pandas, and matplotlib.

---
## About Dataset
This is a simulated dataset exploring how lifestyle habits affect academic performance in students. With 1,000 synthetic student records and 15+ features including study hours, sleep patterns, social media usage, diet quality, mental health, and final exam scores. It's structured, clean, and ready for exploration, modeling, and storytelling

Ever wondered how much Netflix, sleep, or TikTok scrolling affects your grades? 👀 This dataset simulates 1,000 students' daily habits—from study time to mental health—and compares them to final exam scores. It's like spying on your GPA through the lens of lifestyle.

## Techniques Used
### 🧪 Jupyter notebook
 - Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live codes, visualizions.
 - You can write and run code, see outputs instantly under the code cells, and create reports that combine text and visuals in one place.
 
### 🐼 Pandas
- Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- In this project, pandas was used for loading and inspecting the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and calculating summary statistics and trends

### 📊 Matplotlib
- Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- It was used to generate various plots (such as bar charts, histograms, and pie charts) that helped visualize the relationships between student habits and academic performance.
